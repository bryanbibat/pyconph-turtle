# PyConPH 2012 Turtle

Demo git project for PyConPH 2012

## Minor Notes

Github provides multiple ways of accessing your repository. 

Before, the default was with SSH e.g. `git@github.com:bryanbibat/pycon-turtle.git`. But now the default is HTTPS e.g. `https://github.com/bryanbibat/pyconph-turtle.git`.

Ideally, you should use SSH for convenience as you would only need to enter the passphrase once a session in Linux/OSX (you could do the same in Windows with the help of [Pageant](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)) as opposed to what you guys saw earlier with the HTTPS which asks for username and password.
